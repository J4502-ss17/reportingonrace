<p>The first time Dee Dotson went out to the field to plow, he worked until darkness fell. His father called him back to the house, but he protested. He said he was almost finished.</p>
<p>This would’ve been about 80 years ago now. Today’s mechanized agriculture would be almost unrecognizable to Dotson’s teenage self. He’s now 93, but he still works long hours on his farm in northern Mississippi, tending to his four cows and his two small plots of vegetables.</p>
<p>“Mostly I see anything that needs to be done, I mostly do it on the farm,” Dotson says in between
calls to his cows. His customers come to his property to pick their own vegetables.</p>
<p>Dotson’s farm is a relic. It’s only about 62 acres, just 14 percent of today’s average farm size,

according to U.S. Department of Agriculture statistics. A sturdy, hand-made trellis lines the front

side of his garden plot, ready to hold the summer’s runner beans. Onions are interspersed with

turnips, an organic form of gardening that was invented long before the word was trendy. And an

old, hand-drawn well provides a reminder of a time not so long ago when the property had no

running water. The well’s over a hundred years old, and he still uses it in the summer for his

animals.</p>
<p>Back in 1922 when Dotson’s father-in- law purchased the first 40 acres, the farm would’ve

seemed normal for someone starting out, only about half the size of the average farm of that

time. Since then, U.S. acreage in farmland hasn’t changed much, but at least 4 million farms and

their owners have disappeared, government data show. Farms have grown bigger, while the

number of farmers has shrunk. And although the decline of the small farm has been felt across

the country, one group of Americans has been harder hit by the changes than perhaps any other:

African Americans. Today, they make up only around 1 percent of farmers, down from 14

percent in 1920. About 90 percent of black farmers live in the South. They have become all but

invisible.</p>
<p>Dotson is one of the few surviving African-American farmers. At 93, he has difficulty hearing,

so his nephew Frank Taylor shares his story for him. “There is some hope here in rural

America,” says Taylor, as he looks proudly at his uncle. “However, I look on the other side of it.

If my uncle was allowed to sign up for conservation practices through the various governmental

agencies, we would have had a broader and larger farm.”</p>
<p>Taylor says the color of his uncle’s skin prevented him from accessing services from the USDA

and other agencies. That story of discrimination isn’t unique to Dotson. It’s one of the reasons so

few African Americans remain in agriculture today, despite a strong historical legacy that began

with slavery and moved through the post-Civil War days of “40-acres- and-a- mule” and

sharecropping. In 1990, after a series of hearings and several past reports from the U.S.

Commission on Civil Rights, Congress released a report citing the USDA as a catalyst for the

decline of minority farmers. And in a settlement of a 1999 class-action lawsuit known as Pigford

v. Glickman, USDA officials acknowledged the agency’s racially discriminatory practices and

granted around $1 billion to African-American farmers in damages caused by the discrimination.

They also established new bureaucratic procedures aimed at reducing future discrimination.</p>
<p>Taylor now runs the Winston County Self Help Cooperative, which his uncle helped found in

1985 during the farm crisis and which continues to provide resources to small farmers and

particularly African-American farmers. He also owns a tree farm down the road that’s been in his

family since the 1880s. He’s no stranger to the struggles facing African-American land

ownership.</p>
<p>He says when he returned to Northern Mississippi after college and got involved in agriculture in

the late ‘80s, he witnessed the discrimination, making an already tough time for farmers even

tougher. “It was humiliating because you had people (who would) arbitrarily make decisions for

African-American land owners,” he says. “They’d say, ‘No, we’re not going to loan you

anything’ without even having them fill out the application.”</p>
<p>Those who did receive loans, he says, had to report to a credit manager who got to decide

whether they could get money to buy equipment like tractors. Sometimes farmers were awarded

the necessary funds but after the planting season was already over, too late to make a difference.</p>
<p>It’s a story that Shirley Sherrod, co-founder of New Communities in Georgia, knows well. New

Communities lost 6,000 acres of land after an extended drought in the late ‘70s. They applied for

an emergency loan through the Farmers Home Administration, at that time the USDA’s lender of

last resort, but it came three years too late.</p>
<p>“(The program) was there for other farmers, for white farmers,” Sherrod says from a former

plantation home that New Communities now owns outside of Albany, Georgia. “We were told

we get a loan, the county supervisor said, over his dead body.”</p>
<p>So the next time New Communities went to the local office, they brought officials from

Washington with them to get the application. “After that, (the local officials) slowed that process

and did everything they could to block it, but finally after three years we got an emergency

loan,” Sherrod says. “When you&#39;re farming 2,000 acres that&#39;s much too long to go without the

proper input when you’re having continued drought.” The loan had required a lien on all

available assets. In 1985, they lost everything.</p>
<p>Sherrod grew up on a farm in Georgia, about 25 miles from the 3,000-acre plantation that New

Communities now owns. When she was 17, her father was shot by a white farmer over a few

cows, and his murderer was never convicted. Before his death, she’d thought she would leave farming after high school and head North to college, like so many of her peers. “I made the

decision on the night of his death that I would not leave the South,” she says. “I would stay…and

devote my life working for change.”</p>

We all need a country<br>
we call home<br>
A nation bequeathed<br>
to our children<br>
A land of fortress<br>
with our elders<br>
A sanctuary honoring<br>
our dead<br>
We all need ground<br>
beneath our feet<br>
Supporting us as<br>
we rise and fall and rise<br>
Lifting us as we reach<br>
for each other<br>
We all need a space<br>
we know as our center<br>
We all need an anchor<br>
we call our selves </p>
